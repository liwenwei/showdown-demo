# showdown-demo
A Markdown to HTML converter demo base on showdown

# Why?
After googled, there is not a qucik and easy demo for beginner, the [showdowm offical demo](https://github.com/showdownjs/demo) is not hands on demo for beginner, like which js should I use, or if I use this, whether exist a clean demo 

# Note

1. Use bootstrap style sheet  
We can use the bootstrap css to show the converted HTML better, like `blockquote`, `highlight`
